Latticeproteins
===============

`Latticeproteins` is a python package for evaluating 2d lattice protein models.
For a basic example of how to use this package, see the documentation below.

This package was originally written by Jesse Bloom, and later adapted by Zach
Sailer. If you use this package, please cite Jesse's papers:

    * `Protein stability promotes evolvability`_
    * `Stability and the evolvability of function in a model protein`_
