class Fitness(object):
    """Creates a new instance of fitness evaluator.

    Call is: 'f = Fitness(temp, conformations, dGdependence, targets,
        [ligand = None, nofitness = -1e10])'
    'temp' is the temperature at which the fitness is computed.
    'conformations' is the 'conformations.Conformations' object
        used to fold the protein sequences.  'conformations.Length()'
        specifies the length of the protein sequences that can be
        folded.
    'dGdependence' specifies how the fitness depends on the free
        energy of folding of the sequence:
        * if 'dGdependence' is number, then any sequence with a
            free energy of folding <= 'dGdependence' has a fitness
            of one, and any sequence with a free energy of folding
            > 'dGdependence' has a fitness of 'nofitness'.
        * if 'dGdependence' is the string 'fracfolded' then the fitness
            of the sequence is the fraction of the sequences that
            will be folded at temperature 'temp' at equilibrium.
            If 'dG' is the free energy of folding, this fraction is:
            'f = 1 / (1 + exp(dG / temp)'
        * if 'dGdependence' is the string 'negstability', then the
            fitness of the sequence is just negative one times the
            stability of the sequence.  The negative one is so
            that more stable sequences have higher fitnesses.
    'targets' specifies information about the target conformation(s)
        to which the sequence is folded as follows:
        * If 'targets' is 'None' then the protein is folded to its
            lowest energy conformation, whatever this is.
        * If 'targets' is a string specifying a specific conformation
            then the free energies of folding are for folding the
            protein to this specific conformation.
        * If 'targets' is an integer, then this integer specifies the
            number of contacts which the lowest energy conformation
            must have.  If the lowest energy conformation has a
            number of contacts different from 'targets', the
            fitness is 'nofitness'.
    'ligand' is an optional argument that is used if we are looking
        for a protein that binds a ligand.  By default, it is 'None'
        meaning that no ligand binding is considered.  If it is set
        to another value, it should be the 3-tuple '(ligand,
        ligandconf, stabcutoff)' where 'ligand' and 'ligandconf'
        are both strings describing a ligand as detailed in the
        documentation string for the 'conformations.BindLigand'
        method.  'stabcutoff' is a number specifying the
        stability cutoff for the protein to fold.  In this case,
        'dGdependence' no longer has any meaning.  The protein
        is folded according to the parameters 'temp' and
        'targets' as normal.  If the free energy of folding of
        the protein is > 'stabcutoff', then the returned fitness is
        zero.  If the free energy of folding of the protein is <=
        'stabcutoff', then the returned fitness 'exp(-be)' where
        'be' is the binding energy of the ligand to the protein
        in the folded conformation.
    'nofitness' is an optional argument specifying the fitness returned
        for a sequence that does not satisify the requirements set
        by 'dGdependence' or 'targets'.  By default, it is the very
        negative number -1.0e10."""
